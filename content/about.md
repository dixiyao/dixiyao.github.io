I am a Ph.D. student in [iQua](https://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/) at the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/) in the [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca/),advised by [Baochun Li](https://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/bli/">). I received my bachelor degree from Department of [CSE](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. During my undergraduate studies, I was a research intern at [John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by [Liyao Xiang](http://xiangliyao.cn/).Previously, I took a research fellowship at Max Planck Society, advised by [Yiting Xia](https://sites.google.com/view/yitingxia?pli=1) and [Binghang Yuan](https://binhangyuan.github.io/site/). My research interests are in Trustworthy ML and learning in distributed systems, in applications of federated learning and split learning. I'm interested in solving problems with real-world use cases, taking into account privacy, scalability and efficiency.
