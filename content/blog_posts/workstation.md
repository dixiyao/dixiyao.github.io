As machine learning researchers, sometimes we may have the need to have our own GPU workstation. Along with the recent trend of WuKong, I built a 4090 GPU workstation. The total amount excluding the price of GPU is around 1800 before tax. I would like to share my experience about choosing each component and the process of building such a workstation from hardware to software.
