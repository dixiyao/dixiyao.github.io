Taking the qualifying exam is the first milestone for most of the PhD students. I've just passed my qualifying exam on June 12th, 2024 in the ECE department at University of Toronto. I would also like to appreciate my committee ([Ben Liang](https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~liang/index.html), [David Lie](https://security.csl.toronto.edu/), [Michael Stumm](https://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~stumm/),[Andreas Veneris](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~veneris/AndreasVeneris.htm))for helping with the qualifying exams.

Different departments and different universities usually have different policies on how the QE is organized. In the ECE department, the [policy](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/graduates/degree-programs/phd/qualifying/) is that *PhD qualifying examinations to focus on areas relevant to the field and relevant to assessing the students depth of preparation and research ability. The examinations will be at a third-year undergraduate to introductory graduate level.*. We will have either a two-hour meeting with all four committee members participating or two one-hour meetings with two members participating in each. The material will relate to a small part of the research and basic computer science knowledge.

In this blog, I would like to share some of my experiences based on my own qualifying exam, which I hope can help you better prepare for your exams and pass through this important milestone.

## Research
Even if the exams are not oriented on the topic of your research, it is very common that committee members will ask you something about your current research target and your general idea of taking a PhD degree. I think before you start thinking about your research, the very first questions you need to prepare well is **Why do you want to take the PhD program?** **What is your future career plan?** **What is the most important reason motivating you to spend 4-5 years of study?** Such questions are important, especially for the field of computer science. Because if a PhD student having research related to CS were to choose to start working in industry after undergraduate study or master's degree, he could have made much more money. A reasonable answer should be prepared.

Next, you need to prepare for introducing your current research focus to a high-level idea. You may need to introduce the background, some popular solutions and the reason why such a question is important and makes you excited. Having some examples is always a good idea. The professors may not well know your research field, but you need to make them feel they are engaged in the conversation.

## Basic Knowledge
The actual situation may vary case by case. But, here I would like to provide some general guides on the topics you may need to get prepared for.

- Algorithms and Complexity: Calculation of complexity; Turing Machine; P/NP/NPC problems; Sorting algorithms; Trees and algorithms; Sets and algorithms; Greedy algorithms; Dynamic programming algorithms; Graph algorithms etc.
- Computer System, Archtecture, and Oragnization: Each component of a modern PC and how they work; ARM32; Assembly Language etc.
- Operating System: **What is an operating system and why do we need an operating system**; File systems; Unix/Linux, etc.
- Maths and Satistics: Probability; Expectation; Distribution; Large-number Theory; How to use them, etc.


If you are working on research related to artificial intelligence and machine learning, which is very hot recently, you also need to get prepared for very basic knowledge of machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. Here is a [material](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_V2IXoEDJEUs4p7aFYQI7zFvJbnDk1Bx7KCiUIaOgmI/edit#heading=h.qtdb0dv3sd35) from Standford Univeristy. It lists out basic terminologies in the field of machine learning. When you are preparing for your qualifying exam, you can refer to this materia and make sure you can explain and know how to use each technology. The most important thing, how you can make other people understand the concepts. 

Here are some useful cheatsheets better help you review the important concepts in statistics and machine learning:

- [Machine Learning](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-229/)
- [Deep Learning](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-230/)

GOOD LUCK ON YOUR QE!
