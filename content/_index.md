I am a graduate student in [iQua](https://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/) at the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/) in the [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca/),advised by [Baochun Li](https://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/bli/). I received my bachelor degree from Department of [CSE](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. During my undergraduate studies, I was a research intern at [John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by [Liyao Xiang](http://xiangliyao.cn/). Previously, I took a research fellowship at Max Planck Society, advised by [Yiting Xia](https://sites.google.com/view/yitingxia?pli=1) and [Binghang Yuan](https://binhangyuan.github.io/site/). 

My research focuses on **privacy-preserving machine learning in distributed systems**. My research interest includes data privacy, system security, Trustworthy ML, and decentralized trust technologies. I'm interested in solving problems with real-world use cases, facilitating full-stack solutions for data privacy and system security in modern decentralized and AI oriented ecosystem. Here are some examples of my constributions:
    
- How can we realize privacy-preserving split learning and have as much as possible tradeoff for privacy, accuracy and efficiency? [CVPR](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=GuXxYkFBBy), [ICDM](/assests/papers/Privacy-Preserving-Split-Learning-via-Patch-Shuffling-over-Transformers.pdf).
- How can we improve the performance of Federated Learning, without compromising the privacy requirements? [AAAI](/assests/papers/dyao-aaai24.pdf), [ICDCS](assests/papers/Federated_Model_Search_via_Reinforcement_Learning.pdf).
- Open-sourced distributed systems for privacy-preserving machine learning. [IMWUT](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3494981), [ICDCS](assests/papers/lwang-icdcs20.pdf).
