<!-- <-- I'm currently working as a machine learning engineer at [EV.com](https://ev.com) and [CarAI.com](https://www.carai.com/). Previouly, I co-founded a startup company: [Hemlig AI](https://hemligca.github.io/). Hemlig aims to study the cutting edge topics in trustworthy machine learning and implement these techniques into our products. --> -->
I received my Master's degree from the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/) in the [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca/). I previously worked in [iQua](https://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/), advised by [Baochun Li](https://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/bli/). I received my bachelor degree from Department of [CSE](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. During my undergraduate studies, I was a research intern at [John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by [Liyao Xiang](http://xiangliyao.cn/) and [Xinbing Wang](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~wang-xb/). Previously, I took a research fellowship at Max Planck Society, advised by [Yiting Xia](https://sites.google.com/view/yitingxia?pli=1) and [Binghang Yuan](https://binhangyuan.github.io/site/). I speak Mandarin, English, and French.

My research focuses on **privacy-preserving machine learning in distributed systems**. My research interest includes data privacy, system security, Trustworthy ML, and decentralized trust technologies. I'm interested in solving problems with real-world use cases, facilitating full-stack solutions for data privacy and system security in modern decentralized and AI oriented ecosystem. Here are some examples of my constributions:
