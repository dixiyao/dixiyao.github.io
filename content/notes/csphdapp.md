## Introduction
During my preparation for PhD applications, the most response I got are rejection. However, I also received several offers including MASc/PhD in ECE from University of Toronto, PhD in CS from McGill University, PhD in CS from UMASS, PhD in CS from UTexus Austin, EDIC from EPFL, and PhD in CS from NUS. I would like to summarize the application for three stages, which are before application, during application and after application. In different stages, you need to put different things in priority. The key to getting your ideal offer would be mainly composed of your research background and your connections. The other things would be minors and I would like to share more of my experience about that.

Before we get started, I would like to introduce an open-source project: [**opencsapp**](https://opencs.app/), which is managed by my friends. It includes tons of past experience applying to graduate programs in CS. In this post, I would like to lay more emphasis on research.

### Before Application
I would like to use the timeline of an undergraduate student who wants to apply for a direct PhD. as an example. For the preparation, it means the period before the last summer before your final year of study. The last summer is also included. As you can see from the colors in this graph, it will be relatively chill in the first two years and stressed in your third year. However, to make the application easier and smoother, I would like to provide my point of view: prepare early and distribute your workload evenly.

The most critical factor in deciding your application will be your **reference letters** and **connections**. However, to acquire them, you need a strong research background. Rather than saying *have* research experiences, I would like to say *manage* your research experiences. Some people may argue that published papers are important to application and some undergraduate students even have certain papers published in top conferences such as AAAI, CVPR or even SIGMOD, NSDI, SOSP. However, I would say it is only partially correct. I also have a few first-authored papers published in Ubicomp, ICDCS before applying for programs. 

In fact, compared to having the name on author lists, what you really need is the experience of leading a project and doing research independently. Some students just help complete a partial of the source code or just run a couple of experiments. After that, they are granted as a third or fourth author, or even the first author in some particular cases. I would say such a kind of experience is useless and even if you have your name on published papers, it will not really help too much on your application. 

Well, on the other hand, even if your paper is under review, the whole project is led by you. You participate and push the whole project forward from having the idea, writing to finishing all the evaluations. This is valuable and can grant you proper reference letters and connections. In this experience, you learn what research is and know how you can carry out research individually. This is also the reason why most experience of course projects is completely useless and professors do not care about them too much. Course projects are usually done in a group and it is very hard to show that you lead the project unless it is an individual project. In that case, you should emphasize that in your CV.

In summary, before starting research, you need to keep it in mind that your ultimate goal is **having individual research experience before application**.

#### What do I mean by managing research?
Even the god needs seven days to create the world, it is impossible for you to start individual research once you touch it. For the first and second year, you should put your emphasis on your **GPA**. It may sound like a utilitarian but the truth is the reason for taking a course is you want a good **GPA**. Honestly speaking, with the fierce competition nowadays, the objective of going to universities has deviated from our original goals of acquiring knowledge. We just want to get good jobs, good lives, to get a green card in the US or a PR in Canada. But anyway, putting your emphasis on your studies is what I want to say. While in the meantime, get yourself involved in the labs and begin doing research with professors and PhDs.

At the very beginning of the first and the second year. The first thing you need to figure out is whether you really want to do the research in the future. The earlier you figure it out, the more benefits you will get. The next thing is to think about what you want to do in the future. You do not need to narrow down the scope on to a thesis level or a specific topic. This is what you need to think about right after you have just begun the PhD. Just think about a rough direction like machine learning, operating system, database, etc. If you are sure you want to do research and you know what you want to do, the third thing is to think about whether you are really good at it. You need to make sure you really have contributions during your research internship.

After thinking about all these, the next thing is to evaluate your opportunities. If you find that after spending two or three months working for a graduate student, you have nearly zero or very few chances to communicate and talk with the professor, you should quit that lab immediately without a second thought. You need to evaluate how much you have learned during your research assistant experience and whether you can learn to become an individual researcher. And you get a chance to collaborate with the professors! Not just the PhD. Students or master students. This is important. They have not got their degrees. I'm currently still a PhD student and I'm still learning how to do research. PhD students, candidates or even Postdocs are not necessarily clear on doing research and probably not. Otherwise, they should have got their faculty positions. So if you really make contributions and you are really good at what you are doing but you are always collaborating with graduate students or postdocs, it will be a waste of your talent. You should learn from the real professionals, the professors. They are the ones who really understand research. So the most critical thing is you need to make sure you are studying from professors during your research internship!!!

#### Why do you need papers?
The publication and acceptance is highly random nowadays. Accepted papers are not necessarily good papers and good papers will not necessarily be accepted. Moreover, the difficulty to publish a paper varies from conference to conference, from journal to journal and from research scope to research scope. If you have publications when you are applying for the PhD, it will for sure make your application better as long as they are written by yourself. But it is completely fine that you don't have.

The main reason is that you should have the process of managing your mind. You should understand how you build everything up and organize them to make your work well sounded and motivated. In other words, it is the process and what you learned from this process that matters, not the papers. If you don't understand how you should write a good paper, it won't help much for your application even if you have a lot of papers. Nowadays, it is easy to write a paper and submit it to a random conference. Some students may have a very long list of papers and many of them are arxiv preprints. I think this is useless and may even have some counter effects. What you need to do is show your understanding of research and understanding of how you can communicate with others in the form of static texts such as papers.

So, if you have a third or fourth authored paper, it does not help too much. If you have a first authored paper, it is a good thing but you need to know how you demonstrate your understanding of the research.

### The Application
To start with, I will introduce each component of a successful application in the form of timelines.
![timeline](/assets/images/timeline.png)
First, I would like to give you a checklist of each component for your application, accompanied by a checklist of which stage you should prepare for each component. The list is sorted according to importance. If they are notated with a *, it means such a component will not have much impact as you expected. If anything is not listed in this checklist, that means it is useless. Remember this list includes the things you need to prepare. Some important factors such as diversity are not listed. I believe any top university and research group will definitely bring equality to underrepresented groups considering gender, race/ethnicity, physical or metal ability, LGBTQ2+ status, and many more into consideration.

- Connection: First year to 12/15.
- Reference Letters: Sept. to Dec.
- Research Experience: Second year to writing your applications.
- Publications: Second Summer to 12/15.
- Choosing programs and professors: Sept. to Nov.
- CV/Resume: Sept. to Dec.
- Meeting and meeting slides: After 12/15.
- Personal History Statement*: Sept. to Dec.
- SOP/PS/Research Proposal: Sept. to Dec.
- GPA: First year to third year
- Research internship: First/Second/Third summer.
- Connecting professors via email (they don't know you before)*: Sept. to Dec.

Now, I would like to give a guide for each component in this checklist.

### After Application
To choose from your offers, you should also do the same thing of evaluating your opportunities. If you find that after you enter the research group, you will work closely with senior PhD students, candidates and Postdocs rather than your professor, you should reject the offer. In my current and past research, I always have the chance to discuss ideas, progress, results, and writings with my advisors. Basically speaking, your advisor should be the one you collaborate with the most closely. This is a critical factor when you consider your offers.

I would also suggest you communicate with the current PhD students in the research group to understand all the necessary things you think you should acknowledge. In summary, the decision should not be based on what you have and what the prospective supervisor has. It should be based on what you are going to have and what you are going to bring to your prospective supervisor. I strongly recommend you go over these two checklists before you make the final decision.
