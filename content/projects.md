I believe having a good code repo is a necessary part of a good paper. You can find the source code for my papers and other interesting projects through my [Github](https://github.com/dixiyao).

Apart from source code for my papers, I would like to share some of my interesting projects, tutorials and useful resources. I also share some interesting spaces, models, and datasets I created during my past projects on my [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/dixiyao). 


## Tutorials
### Large Language Model
[Finetune a Large Laguage Model with Torchtune](https://github.com/dixiyao/dixiyao.github.io/wiki/Using-Torchtune-to-Fine%E2%80%90tune-an-LLM)     
[Create an Arxiv Paper Dataset](https://github.com/dixiyao/dixiyao.github.io/wiki/Create-an-Arxiv-Paper-Dataset)

## Open-source Software Framework
[LLM for Academic Writing](https://github.com/dixiyao/LLM-Academic-Writing): This is a collection of helpful LLM tools I have found and developed. They leverage large generative models to improve academic writing.

[Plato](https://github.com/TL-System/plato): A New Framework for Scalable Federated Learning Research.
- [Federated Neural Architecture Search](https://github.com/TL-System/plato/tree/main/examples/model_search)
- [System-heterogenous Federated Learning](https://github.com/TL-System/plato/tree/main/examples/model_search/sysheterofl)
- [Split Learning](https://github.com/TL-System/plato/tree/main/examples/split_learning)
- [Personalized Federated Learning](https://github.com/TL-System/plato/tree/main/examples/personalized_fl)

[Edge-Cloud Computing Framework](https://github.com/dixiyao/Context-Aware-Compilation-of-DNN-Training-Pipelines-across-Edge-and-Cloud): An egde-cloud computing framework across the IoT devices and a public cloud server for deep learning models.

- [Medical Image Classification](https://github.com/dixiyao/ECE1513)

## Useful Tools
- [SpecNet](https://github.com/dixiyao/SpecNet): Replication of a series of networks completely training and inferencing over spectral/frequency domain. 
- [Non-IID Dataset Creater](https://github.com/dixiyao/Create-Non-IID-dataset-torch): A interface to create non-i.i.d. dataset quickly in federated learning.
